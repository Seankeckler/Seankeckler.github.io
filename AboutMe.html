  <main role="main" class="inner cover">
    <p class="lead">I started my love for languages in a different area,
      studying Sign Language at GRCC, I was working at a company called Alternative Pathways.
      Taking care of adults with mental and physical disabilities,
      I started learning because my main client happened to be deaf.
      <br>
      <br>
I fell away from that role when my family began to grow.
So I went back to college to learn auto mechanics.
I started a job at Borgman ford while I was still learning,
I was hired as a Quick lane technician,
I started showcasing my skills by asking to take on jobs that required more knowledge and understanding.
While performing these jobs I was asked to transition over to the used car department.
When I was at a loss, I would turn to the internet, as most people do. I would find myself,
more often than not, finding the answers quickly but without the actual physical knowledge of how to
perform the tasks, still taking longer than I would have liked on the jobs.
<br>
<br>
Realizing that maybe automotive wasn’t for me,
I went back to school again. I went to a bootcamp for C# and found that I was in love with it.
I learned quickly and gained rapport with the other students.
I was enjoying myself everyday, even if the problems that I was solving were small. Come Final Project time,
I remember Sweating profusely on a stage in front of about 100 or
so people that had come just to see the project that my team and I were working on.
<br>
<br>
During my hunt for development work I found someone who made their own language(lavishscript), and began an
apprenticeship with him. Learning a new language proved difficult, but again, fun and rewarding.
We began building little instruments for his project ISboxer.
<br>
<br>
During the Lavishscript phase I also took part in a local development conference here (Grand Rapids), called
BeerCityCode. I have been apart of the development conference for a couple years, but I mostly just did
mundane, physical assistance, like placing and picking up chairs, cleaning up some of the clutter
out of Calvin College, and some minor tech support when the technology wasn't working. Learning that
founder of the program decided to step back out of the role, new roles opened up and became available.
I quickly got on board and asked to maintain the website, <a target="_blank" href="https://beercitycode.com">beercitycode</a>,
updating the information and re-working some of the old and putting in some new.
<br>
<br>
From there I went to Spectrum health and found that they made most of their jobs are available to
internal applicants only. So I put in an application for their Help Desk, got the job, and that is where I
sit today. Still striving to learn more, to do more, and to smile the whole way.
